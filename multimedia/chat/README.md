if u have problem with RTC, Its maybe for SSL
There is security bug for domain transfer from proxy in ice servers...
then leave proxy strategy, Map domain on ur ip, install easyrtc, use edited version of server.js in ur server example folder with ur ssl certificates and dont control domain with apache
dont forget the port number for ssl is fake, this is a trick :)
